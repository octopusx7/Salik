## Introduction
---

Salik is an artificial intelligence program that helps preserve the environment by using drones to detect and monitor visual pollution on roads. This allows for the identification of contamination, its location, and an approximate cost for its repair. Consequently, relevant authorities can be promptly informed to address the problem as quickly as possible.

## Objectives
---
- Minimize visual pollution through urban planning
- Reduce Maintenance Costs 
- Improve road safety 
## Features
---
- It detects potholes and calculates an approximate repair cost based on data from [The British government for the year 2017/2018](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/dataset/potholes-and-expenditure).
- It detects barrier.
- It detects sidewalk.

## Dataset Description
---

Visual Pollution (VP) is the visible deterioration and bad aesthetic quality of the natural and human-made landscapes. It also refers to the disruptive occurrence that limits the movability of the people on the public roads such as excavation barriers, potholes, and dilapidated sidewalks. The real VP dataset is collected from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) regions via the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MOMRAH) and used to develop the proposed deep learning framework.
